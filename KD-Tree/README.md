# Implementation

In this file, i implement a KD-Tree with k=2 and an Orthogonal Range Search function. The implementation is recursive . 
I use a class called Point,in which i store the coordinates of each point.
Then, i initiate a class called KD-Node which is the class i use for the recursive insertion and search of KD-Tree.
For further information, you can check kdtree.py. This file includes all functions and extensive annotation for each one of them.

# Brief Instructions

In order to execute the Python file called kdtree.py, you have to run this command through a terminal:
<pre>python3 kdtree.py</pre>

Then, you need to insert the range of coordinates of the points. After that, you have to insert the number of points 
that are going to be created. After those insertions, you are going to see printed the range of coordinates of the points.
Additionally, you have to insert the dimensions of the orthogonal range query. The dimensions are saved as a list.
