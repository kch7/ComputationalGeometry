# Computational Geometry
This repository contains the implementation of incremental algorithm for the 3D Convex Hull and the implementation of the Delaunay Triangulation via lifting. Also, it includes a simple and comprehensive implementation for KD-Tree with k=2. Additionally, i have implemented Voronoi Diagrams via the method of tangent planes.


# Instructions

In order to download locally my repository, you have to execute these commands:

<pre>git clone https://github.com/kch7/ComputationalGeometry.git</pre>
<pre>pip install -r requirements.txt</pre>
<pre>cd ComputationalGeometry</pre>

And then you can navigate to the folder you want and execute the algorithm you wish.

For instance, if you want to navigate to the folder containing the implementation of KD-Tree, 
then you have to insert this command into the terminal:

<pre>cd ComputationalGeometry/KD-Tree</pre>

And then, you can run the .py file called KD-Tree.
The process is the same for all implementations of this repository.
